## NOMAD: Network Optimization for Multimodal Decision-making
### Overview
This repository contains the code for NOMAD, a software that constructs a multimodal, multi-cost, time-dependent network model of a transportation system. The design decisions associated with NOMAD are detailed in the publication *Constructing a routable multimodal, multi-cost, time-dependent network model with all emerging mobility options: methodology and case studies*.
